## Setting up Elasticsearch

Download Elasticsearch from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch. After extracting the downloaded zip file, browse into "elasticsearch-x.x.0/bin" folder and run ./elasticsearch. This will start elasticsearch on the default port 9200. 

## Data

Details about rulers were scraped from [Wikipedia](https://si.wikipedia.org/) website. The data was manually curated from several wikipedia pages. After carrying out further preprocessing and cleaning steps to remove redundancies and inconsistencies the final dataset is obtained. The dataset consists of following data fields.

- Name (නම)
- Period (රාජ්‍ය සමය)
- Marriages (විවාහයන්)
- Death (මරණය)
- House (රාජවංශය/පක්ෂය)
- Capital (රාජධානිය/අගනගරය)
- Predecessor (පූර්වප්‍රාප්තිකයා)
- Successor (අනුප්‍රාප්තිකයා)
- Details (විස්තර)


## Indexing Process

You can create the index and add the custom analyzers and the mappings as follows. The files stopwords.txt, stems.txt, synonyms.txt can be found inside the ElasticSearch folder. They were created based on two corpuses, https://github.com/nlpcuom/Sinhala-Stopword-list and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shilpasayura/sinhala-nltk/master/sinhala-stemmer/stem_dictionary.txt.

## Indexing and Querrying Techniques

- **Tokenization**

Standard tokenizer is used during for the tokenizaton process.

- **Stop word filtering and stemming**

- **Rule based classification**

A rule based classification is used to classify the search queries into different categories of searches. Different rules are applied based on the search phrase keywords after splitting the search phrase into tokens.

- **Boosting**

Boosting is used as a query optimization technique. Each data field of a search is boosted with a predefined value based on the keywords in the search phrase.

- **Facet and Range queries**
Range queries are also supported such as last kings in Anuradhapura. Also, facet queries are supported such as the number of kings in each era for the search results.


- **Multi-match queries**
- **Boolean queries**
- **Sorting**
